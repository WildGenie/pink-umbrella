# Why Pink Umbrella?
Pink Umbrella was created out of the community needs at Seattle's Capitol Hill Occupy Protest (CHOP), formerly known as CHAZ. The Pink Umbella during [Chief Best's and Mayor Jenny's repeated use of tear gas and pepper spray on the Capitol Hill community](https://southseattleemerald.com/2020/06/08/police-use-tear-gas-on-capitol-hill-protestors-allegedly-misuse-explosive-crowd-control-devices-in-medic-tent/) has become a symbol of solidarity and non-violent protest against a violent police state, which is why in that spirit we have created open source software to support non-violent protests and the Black/Trans Lives Matter movement.

Our core values written by the community are to **prioritize privacy, transparency, and communication within the community**, and we have done that in the following ways:
- We have open sourced our goals and features list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13RdzrgGWLu21BfCVKf5BBSJgpk2cvhixYOZnRv1bITM/edit#).
- We have open sourced our code here on GitHub. Contributors, technical and non-technical are welcomed and encouraged.
- We have opened many communication channels for direct communication with the community.
